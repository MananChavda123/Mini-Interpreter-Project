This is the Read Me file on the Mini Interpreter Project.

We have implemented a really small subset of Scala Programming language.

We have implemented: 
1. Arithmetic Operators.
2. Logical Operators.
3. Comparison Operators.
4. Assignment Operators.
5. Conditional Statement - (if- else) statement.
6. Looping Statement - while loop.
7. Function - Small Basic Functions.

A Brief Summary on the implementation.
1. We have followed the operator precedence
- Primary(Number , Strings)
- Unary Operator like ! and - 
- Multiplication ( * , / )
- Addition  ( + , - )
- Comparison (> , < , >= , <= , ==, != )
- equality (!= , ==)
- Logical Operator(and, or)

2.Assignment Statement 
- Variables are Declared using var keyword.
- Variables can be declared first and initialized or can only declared and later initialised.

3.Conditional Statement
- We have only implemented if and else.

4.Looping Statement
- We have implemented While loop.

5.Functions
- Functions can be declared using def keyword.
- We can have parameterized functions, and can be called as many times.


Learning from this project;

1. Learned how to the write a Lexical Analyzer(as said by author).
2. Learned how to write a Recursive Decent Parser.
3. What is the symbol table, and parse tree.
4. We learn how to express languages grammar without ambiguity using BNF.
5. Learned about the syntax and semantics of the programming language.
